We implement a quantitative equity strategy whereby we select stocks from the Stoxx Europe 50 index which comprises of the 50 largest european stocks by market capizalization. (check). 
Inspired by the "dogs of the dow strategy which predicts an outperformance of the 10 highest dividend yielding stocks in the dow vs the total index, we restrict the portfolio to be long in the top 10 dividend yielding stocks in the stoxx europe 50. Additionally, we go short in the 10 lowest yielding dividend stocks. 

We caltulate the optimal weights by calculating the Maximum Sharp Ratio Portfolio.
